Chess.comBot
============

- This makes use of 2 different chess engines to attempt to avoid detection
- I had it using 4 but it requires a lot of cpu and ram
- Where the program picks up and drops pieces is random
- The speed of mouse movement is random
- The mouse idly moves randomly
- The time between moves is based on the time the opponents last move took+randomness
- the time to move pieces is random
- the intelligence of the engine is much faster at beginning(to mirror human openings)
- this could be a lot more effecient, but I wanted to try to avoid detection by the chess.com server
- by no means do I recommend using this, it was a fun project I made

SETTINGS
============

- board setting extra large
- board colour is irrelevant
- white always on bottom, always queen on promotion
- highlight squares of last move, show coords in board
- make your profile pic this image(a solid red 200*200 box): http://i.imgur.com/wUg1tqY.png
- All coordinates require you to have the extra large board, if it doesnt fit properly it wont work
- left monitor and Chrome maximized with the Bookmarks Toolbar enabled.
- It may work with other browsers, but untested
- browser must be in the topleft
- ex: http://i.imgur.com/iHTidUE.png

- 64 bit may be required as well
